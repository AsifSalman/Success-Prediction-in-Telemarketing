# Success-Prediction-in-Telemarketing-
This repo will guide you through the basic analysis, EDA and the prediction in the success of bank telemarketing.
# What the project is about?
The main objective of this project is to handle missing values, explore inter-feature relationship, analyze the relationship and predict the success of bank campaign by telemarketing. The problem statement is as follows and copied directly from UCI (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). The binary classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a bank term deposit.
# What is the task?
The task is build an algorithm that indicates the success rate of campaign of the bank. We were provided with bank client data, related data with the last contact of the current campaign, social and economic context attributes and other attributes.  
# What action did I take?
To predict the success rate, I had to tackle the problem following the standard data science pipelines. I filled the missing data, analyze the data set, visualized the distribution when necessary, performed feature engineering trained the model and evaluated the performance using different machine learning algorithms. The actions were well described and demonstrated in the codes.
# Codes
-Basic_data _analysis_and_visualization.ipynb: The task of the code can be subdivided in following groups:
-Importing the libraries and data set
 o	Preprocess the data
 o	Perform basic descriptive analysis from the features
 o	Provide necessary EDA
 o	Analyzing individual features and see if there's any effect
â€¢	Prediction_and_performance_comparison.ipynb: This code mainly related with some knowledge from the previous codes and performs prediction:
 o	Perform all necessary feature engineering 
 o	Build the trained model
 o	Make prediction
 o	Evaluate the accuracy of the model
# Results
From the analysis, I found that the model is required more modification.
